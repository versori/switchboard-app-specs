  title: Square Connect API
  description: |-
    The Square Webhooks API is used to manage webhook subscriptions.

    This specification is not actually supported by Switchboard since the API is designed to be used by the Square 
    dashboard and authentication is based on cookies and not the traditional OAuth 2.0 flows. This specification can 
    only be used to use a webhook as a board trigger, and it's the user's responsibility to configure the webhook 
    themselves from the Square dashboard.
    
    Note: This specification is a work-in-progress, currently only customer.created has been implemented.
